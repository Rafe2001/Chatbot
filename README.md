## Overview

The Chatbot Project is designed to simulate a conversation with users by understanding their queries and providing appropriate responses. It uses a simple neural network model to classify user input into predefined intent categories and generates responses based on the detected intent.

## Features

- Supports various user intents such as greetings, inquiries, help requests, and more.
- Provides dynamic responses based on the detected intent and predefined patterns.
- Easy-to-understand codebase that can be extended and customized.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Chatbot Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/Rafe2001/Chatbot.git
  

2. Install the required dependencies. You can use the following command:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
  

3. [Optional] Train the chatbot model using your dataset or predefined intents.

## Usage

To interact with the chatbot, run the `chat.py` script. You can input your queries, and the chatbot will generate responses based on the trained model.

python chat.py

Feel free to customize and expand the chatbot's functionalities to suit your specific use case.

## Dependencies
